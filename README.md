# Data Structures & Algorithm Implementations

## Overview

This project consolidates a series of **data structures and algorithm implementations** developed in **C++**, focusing on correctness, efficiency, and systematic problem-solving. The work emphasizes how fundamental data structures support scalable algorithms and how design choices affect runtime and memory behavior.

The repository reflects hands-on experience translating theoretical concepts into **robust, executable programs**.
